-- The job of this file is to reset all of our important database tables.
-- And add any data that is needed for the tests to run.
-- This is so that our tests, and application, are always operating from a fresh
-- database state, and that tests don't interfere with each other.

-- First, we must delete (drop) all our tables
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS books;
DROP SEQUENCE IF EXISTS books_id_seq;

-- Then, we recreate them
CREATE SEQUENCE IF NOT EXISTS books_id_seq;
CREATE TABLE books (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255),
    author_name VARCHAR(255)
);

-- Finally, we add any records that are needed for the tests to run
INSERT INTO books (title, author_name) VALUES ('Nineteen Eighty-Four', 'George Orwell');
INSERT INTO books (title, author_name) VALUES ('Mrs Dalloway', 'Virginia Woolf');
INSERT INTO books (title, author_name) VALUES ('Emma', 'Jane Austen');
INSERT INTO books (title, author_name) VALUES ('Dracula', 'Bram Stoker');
INSERT INTO books (title, author_name) VALUES ('The Age of Innocence', 'Edith Wharton');
